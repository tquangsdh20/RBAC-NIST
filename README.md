## RBAC Models

There are 4 levels of RBAC Model as the followings:

- **RBAC0**: *contains the minimum functionality for an RBAC system*
- **RBAC1**: *includes the RBAC0 functionality and adds role hierarchies, which enable one role to inherit permissions from another role*
- **RBAC2**: *includes RBAC0 and adds constraints, which restrict the ways in which the components of a RBAC system may be configured*
- **RBAC3**: *contains the functionality of RBAC0, RBAC1, and RBAC2*
